    {
      "question": "How do I add papers to multiple topics?",
      "answer": "Use the search panel's topic picker when adding papers. Each paper can belong to multiple topics simultaneously."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the context budget indicator mean?",
      "answer": "It estimates how much of the model's context window is used by your documents and conversation history. Green (<50%), amber (<80%), red (>=80%). When red, consider clearing history or using fewer papers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do queries take so long?",
      "answer": "Shesha uses Recursive Language Models: the LLM writes Python code to explore your documents, runs it in a Docker sandbox, examines the output, and repeats. This multi-step approach takes 1-3 minutes but produces more accurate results."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I cancel a running query?",
      "answer": "Yes. Press Escape while a query is running, or the query will be interrupted at the next iteration boundary."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the citation check?",
      "answer": "It verifies that claims in the LLM's answer are actually supported by the source documents. The report shows verified, unverified, and missing citations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I export my conversation?",
      "answer": "Click the export button (download icon) in the header to download a Markdown transcript of the current topic's conversation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do papers take a while to download?",
      "answer": "arXiv has rate limits. Shesha waits 3.1 seconds between downloads to avoid being blocked. LaTeX papers also need parsing which takes additional time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I change the LLM model?",
      "answer": "Click the model name in the status bar at the bottom to change the model. Any model supported by LiteLLM can be used."
