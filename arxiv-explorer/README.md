# Shesha arXiv Explorer — Setup Guide

Shesha is a research tool that uses Recursive Language Models to help you explore and query arXiv papers. You add papers to topics, then ask natural language questions. The LLM writes code to explore the documents, runs it in a sandbox, and iterates until it finds an answer.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** — see [Installing Docker](#installing-docker) below if you don't have it
- An **LLM API key** — see [Getting an API Key](#getting-an-api-key) below
- **Model selection** — set `SHESHA_MODEL` (see [Choosing a Model](#choosing-a-model) below)

### Installing Docker

Docker runs the code sandbox that Shesha uses to safely execute LLM-generated code. If you already have Docker installed, skip to [Quick Start](#quick-start).

**macOS**

1. Download [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Open the downloaded `.dmg` file and drag Docker to your Applications folder
3. Launch Docker from Applications — you'll see a whale icon in your menu bar when it's running

**Windows**

1. Download [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts (enable WSL 2 when asked)
3. Restart your computer if prompted
4. Launch Docker Desktop from the Start menu — you'll see a whale icon in your system tray when it's running
5. Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt** to run the commands below

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**

```bash
# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh

# Allow your user to run Docker without sudo
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Log out and back in, then verify
docker run hello-world
```

For other Linux distributions, see the [official Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

**Verify Docker is working**

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
docker --version
```

You should see something like `Docker version 27.x.x`. If you get "command not found", Docker isn't installed or isn't in your PATH.

### Getting an API Key

You need an API key from one of the supported LLM providers. Pick whichever you prefer:

**OpenAI**

1. Go to [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and sign in (or create an account)
2. Click "Create new secret key" and copy it
3. Set it: `export SHESHA_API_KEY="sk-..."`

**Anthropic (Claude)**

1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/) and sign in (or create an account)
2. Go to Settings > API Keys, click "Create Key", and copy it
3. Set it: `export SHESHA_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."`

**Google (Gemini)**

1. Go to [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and sign in with your Google account
2. Click "Create API Key", select a project, and copy the key
3. Set it: `export SHESHA_API_KEY="your-key-here"`

All three providers require billing to be set up for production use, though Google offers a free tier with up to 1,000 daily requests.

### Choosing a Model

Set `SHESHA_MODEL` to tell Shesha which LLM to use. These are good budget-friendly options that work well for paper exploration:

| Provider | Model | `SHESHA_MODEL` value | Approximate cost |
|----------|-------|---------------------|-----------------|
| OpenAI | GPT-5 mini | `gpt-5-mini` | $0.25 / $2.00 per 1M tokens |
| Anthropic | Claude Haiku 4.5 | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | $1.00 / $5.00 per 1M tokens |
| Google | Gemini 2.5 Flash | `gemini/gemini-2.5-flash` | $0.30 / $2.50 per 1M tokens |

Costs shown are input / output per million tokens. A typical research session uses roughly 100K–500K tokens.

For the best balance of cost and quality, we recommend **`gpt-5-mini`** (OpenAI) or **`gemini/gemini-2.5-flash`** (Google).

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/shesha.git
cd shesha/arxiv-explorer

# 2. Set your API key and model
export SHESHA_API_KEY="sk-..."
export SHESHA_MODEL="gpt-5-mini"   # recommended: inexpensive with great results

# 3. Run
docker compose up
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## First Research Session

1. **Create a topic** — Click the `+` button in the left sidebar and name it (e.g., "Abiogenesis")
2. **Search for papers** — Click the search icon in the header and search arXiv (e.g., "origin of life RNA world")
3. **Add papers** — Select papers from the results and click "Add". Papers download in the background (there's a 3-second delay between downloads to respect arXiv's rate limits)
4. **Ask a question** — Once papers appear as chips above the chat area, type a question like "What are the main theories for the origin of life?"
5. **Wait for the answer** — The status bar shows the current phase and token count. Queries typically take 1-3 minutes
6. **Inspect the trace** — Click "View trace" on any answer to see the LLM's step-by-step reasoning
7. **Check citations** — Click the checkmark icon in the header to verify the LLM's citations against the source documents

## Troubleshooting

**Docker not running**
Shesha needs Docker to run code in a sandbox. On macOS and Windows, open Docker Desktop from your Applications/Start menu and wait for the whale icon to appear. On Linux, run `sudo systemctl start docker`.

**API key not set**
Set `SHESHA_API_KEY` as an environment variable before running.

**Papers fail to download**
arXiv may be temporarily unavailable. Wait a minute and try again. Some papers with non-standard formats may fail to parse.

**Context budget at 80%+**
Your documents and conversation history are approaching the model's context limit. Consider clearing the conversation history or switching to a model with a larger context window.

**Port already in use**
Use `--port 8080` (or another port) if 8000 is taken.

## Notice

This is **experimental software**. The web interface is under active development. Some features may be incomplete or change without notice.
